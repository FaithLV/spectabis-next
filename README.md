# spectabis-next

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/Spectabis/SpectabisNext/_apis/build/status/FaithLV.spectabis-next?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/Spectabis/SpectabisNext/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Spectabis is a free and open-source graphical frontend for [`PCSX2`](https://pcsx2.net/). Its purpose is to add aditional features which make using the PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulator easier and faster. This allows you to use PCSX2 with per-game configuration and many additional features and benefits. This source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](LICENSE).

Currently usable but not useful yet.

*Please Note:* If you're building the desktop client from source, you will **not** be able to connect to the service and online functionality will not work. You can host the service locally though.
