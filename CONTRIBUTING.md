## Reporting issues

When opening a new issue, please follow the information below:

* Steps to trigger the problem that are specific, and repeatable
* What happens when you follow the steps, and what you expected to happen instead.
* Include the full console crash message ([see here](./docs/sharing-logs.md))  using [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
